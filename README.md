# diplomski-bongritic

Bongritic is a sytem designed for honest and non-biased ratings for video games. 
It is comprised of three front-end applications each representing a user type.
It is built using the React.js framework(with typescript) and one back-end Node application built using the Express.js framework.
The back-end side is deployed on Heroku while the three front end apps are deployed using AWS Amplify.

Besides being my thesis project which required me to make a functional MVP out of this idea, the point of this project for me was to demonstrate all the skills I have learened during my three years of learning to code.
